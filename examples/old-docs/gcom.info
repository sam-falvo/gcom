Generic Component Object Model
******************************

The Generic Component Object Model, or GCOM, is an open source
implementation of Microsoft's COM middle-ware technology.  GCOM was
written primarily as a learning tool, to figure out how it worked under
the hood.  Since then, it has evolved to a stable, in-process-only COM
implementation, absolutely ideal for application extensibility uses.
Future development of GCOM will take it into the realm of distributed
objects, supporting an object RPC mechanism that will likely be built on
top of the BEEP protocol.

1 Why COM?
**********

The Generic Component Object Model, or GCOM, is an open source
implementation of Microsoft's COM middle-ware technology.  GCOM was
written primarily as a learning tool, to figure out how it worked under
the hood.  Once GCOM became stable with respect to in-process servers, I
was asked to port GCOM to the Amiga DE environment.  This was GCOM's
first production-grade application, where it became the Andromeda
subsystem.  Andromeda is, unfortunately, no longer used in the Amiga
software.  Still, after all these years of development with it, I have
never heard of a single bug report.

1.1 COM's Advantages
====================

COM has several advantages with respect to CORBA.

  1. COM is faster for the most often used case: invoking in-process
     objects.  Most applications are responsible for maintaining large
     collections of related objects.  The overwhelming majority of
     these application objects will reside in the application's memory
     space.  Therefore, it seems logical to conclude that the critical
     control flow path to invoking methods on these objects be made as
     short and as direct as possible.  COM does this.

     CORBA, however, doesn't permit this to occur without the
     development of a proprietary Object Adaptor.  The single fastest
     ORB I've seen, while still employing the CORBA POA specification
     is ORBit, where the control flow path must still traverse two if()
     statements, and at least one array dereference, before the
     functionality of the object is invoked.

  2. COM is a "binary" standard, instead of a "paper" standard, letting
     many different language bindings exist in the same execution
     domain, thus creating faster in-process communications between
     different language environments.

  3. COM is easy to understand, even trivial, how it works.  I wrote
     GCOM with the intent on learning how to make a CORBA-like or
     COM-like system, from scratch.  GCOM was completed in less than a
     week's worth of coding effort.  One does not need to master an
     interface description language to use COM, like one does with
     CORBA(1).

  4. COM is scalable - no part of the remoting infrastructure need be
     considered when restricting yourself exclusively to in-process
     objects.  Contrast this with CORBA, where the remoting
     infrastructure is omnipresent; from the first time you write your
     first CORBA application, you're dealing with such concepts as
     Interoperable Object References, resolving initial object
     references, registering objects so the ORB can properly route
     incoming RPC calls, et. al.  This is not to say that CORBA is
     inherently bad because of this, but it does make the learning curve
     for CORBA steeper than for COM.

  5. COM provides effortless custom marshaling capabilities, for when
     IDL-generated proxies and stubs are not sufficient.  To date, I
     have not seen any standard method for incorporating this kind of
     functionality in CORBA.  If it does exist, it's ORB-specific, and
     thus, non-portable.

  6. COM provides effortless detection of an object's abilities via
     interface aggregation and interrogation.  With CORBA you need to
     compare the object's interface ID against a known inherited
     interface to determine if the object satisfies the requirements of
     an interface (or risk having to deal with "method not found"
     exceptions being thrown by the ORB).

  7. Remote COM methods are dispatched by number, not by name.  Since
     the ordering of methods in an interface is known a priori, method
     invokation is a simple table look-up operation, which executes in
     fixed time.  CORBA spends a large amount of time comparing
     _strings_ to dispatch a method.  This very often involves heavily
     nested IF-constructs in the language binding to eek out the most
     performance that is possible, thus resulting in excessive code
     size, and a general _reduction_ in dispatch throughput.

  8. COM's use of reference counting is a mixed blessing: on the one
     hand, object maintenance is greatly simplified, but it does place
     a greater burden on the programmer to ensure that no cycles can be
     created.  There seems to be no firm consensus on whether this is
     an advantage or disadvantage.  However, as environments such as
     Gnome are demonstrating, it appears that reference counting indeed
     solves more problems than it creates.


1.2 Common Concerns about COM
=============================

Many people have raised certain concerns with respect to COM, and how
viable it is as a middleware technology.  I hope to address some of
these concerns below.

  1. COM does require more boilerplate code up-front than CORBA when
     implementing an object type.  For example, when implementing an
     object server library, one has to remember to also implement class
     factory objects for each kind of object the library supports, as
     well as the normal COM object implementations themselves.  Then
     there are library-global functions used to determine when it's
     safe to unload the library.  For each kind of object, supporting
     object creation with Microsoft's defined aggregation rules
     requires more in-depth understanding of how to write the
     `IUnknown::QueryInterface()' method(2).

     IDL compilers would take care of all these matters largely
     automatically, but the fact remains: if you compare the output of
     a COM-aware IDL compiler and a CORBA-aware IDL compiler, more code
     will appear in the COM sources, at least for small component
     library implementations.

     However, the boiler-plate grows more slowly than it does with
     CORBA.  CORBA's boiler-plate is per-object and per-method, not per
     library or per server process(3).  Therefore, the more methods an
     object implementation supports, and the more kinds of objects that
     a process supports, the more boiler-plate code the IDL compiler
     introduces.  There is very little re-use between this code.

  2. It is often said that COM lacks innate support for exceptions like
     CORBA has, but this is not strictly a problem either.  There are
     three approaches to resolving this issue, none of which requires
     any changes to the core COM concepts.

     First, calling conventions can be made to support exception
     passing in a manner not unlike CORBA's C-language mapping.  More
     importantly, interfaces which don't throw exceptions needn't pass
     an exception pointer with every method call, like CORBA's C
     mapping requires.  IDL compilers can automate and, to a limited
     extent, even hide this mapping precisely as CORBA's IDL does, when
     necessary.

     The second approach, and I think this is one that Microsoft's DCOM
     implementation takes(4), is that each thread has a thread-global
     object that implements `IException'.  When invoking a remote
     method, if an exception is thrown, the RPC objects are responsible
     for unmarshaling these exception conditions, and setting the
     `IException' object for the thread.  Then, the proxy object that
     the client calls through is responsible for detecting the
     exception and invoking the relavent language-specific mapping for
     it.

     The third approach that I can think of is to require the _object
     itself_ to support an interface like `IException'.  If an error
     occurs invoking a method on the object, then the object state
     itself is responsible for keeping track of the erroneous
     condition.  This has the advantage that it does not require any
     thread-local storage or other OS-specific features.  It is
     directly implementable by any COM object implementation,
     regardless of whether it's working on a Commodore 64 or a CDC
     Cyber 64-bit architecture.

  3. It is often said that COM lacks the concept of a unique object
     identity.  There are actually two facets to this concern: locating
     an object by name, and comparing an object's identity against
     another object reference.

     First, we tackle the problem of naming a unique object.  In CORBA,
     an interoperable object reference ("IOR") is basically a pointer
     to an object instance that (hopefully) continues to exist.  Since
     IORs are stored externally from a program, a process wanting to
     use the object must read in the IOR's contents, then invoke
     `ORB::string_to_object()'.  This returns an object reference the
     program can understand and use directly.  So that the ORB can know
     ahead of time what proxy to instantiate, the IOR also includes
     with it the object's type ID.  Therefore, the application receives
     an object reference to the appropriate proxy when
     `ORB::string_to_object()' returns.

     However, what CORBA calls IORs are known as "monikers" in the COM
     world.  According to Merriam Webster's online dictionary(5), a
     moniker is defined as:

          Main Entry: mon·i·ker Variant(s): also mon·ick·er /'mä-ni-k&r/
          Function: noun Etymology: probably from Shelta (language of
          Irish itinerants) munnik, modification of Irish ainm : NAME,
          NICKNAME

     As one might expect, a "moniker" in the COM community is some kind
     of object that _refers_ to another object.  A typical moniker might
     simply be a well-formed text file that includes a URI of some kind
     (e.g., `http://www.falvotech.com' is a valid moniker), along with
     what kind of object it is, usually in the form of an embedded
     "CLSID".  Of course, more sophisticated moniker representations
     can exist as well, but are rarely needed.

     The second half of the issue is testing objects for equal
     identity.  It is true that COM provides no innate way to compare
     an object reference for identity, because applications simply
     don't have object references; they have interface references
     instead.  Therefore, to achieve the goal of identity comparison,
     the relavent objects must implement an interface which has an
     identity comparison method.  If the object is remote, this could
     incur run-time overheads if the application needs to compare
     identities on a large number of objects(6).

     Fortunately, it turns out that this is a relatively rare operation
     to perform.  In most cases, entire objects are not used as search
     keys except in some pretty rare applications.  Usually a more
     primitive data type is used to look for or collate objects.
     Furthermore, for those objects that both require identity checks
     and high performance, COM's flexibility to implement custom
     proxies can be exploited to permit identity caching, thus keeping
     all identity-relavent state information local to the application,
     something CORBA doesn't provide any (standard) equivalent for.

  4. Finally, distributed COM objects often require the use of
     "pinging" to see if remote objects are still alive.  Of course,
     even this is not nearly as big a problem as most make it out to
     be; pings can be piggy-backed on top of other remote requests, and
     if necessary, can even be turned off completely, in precisely the
     same way that TCP ACK packets are piggy-backed on other TCP
     messages to a given machine.


   All in all, the most commonly voiced disadvantages to COM seem
all-together insignificant when viewed against the larger backdrop of
the problems it solves.  I feel, for instance, that CORBA's lack of
support for in-process objects is a devastatingly serious disadvantage
to using CORBA for desktop environments, for example.

1.3 COM's Only Incontrovertible Disadvantage
============================================

The only disadvantage that COM has is its lack of public documentation
to serve as a reference for other implementations.  The COM 0.9
_preliminary_ specifications document is available for download off of
Microsoft's website, and indeed, is what GCOM itself is based off of.
However, it doesn't cover the full gamut of COM's implementation nuances
on the Windows platform.  This is a deliberate decision on the part of
Microsoft.

   Therefore, GCOM, while it has an interface that adheres to the 0.9
specifications, _must stop there._  That is to say, everything else in
the GCOM environment is GCOM specific, because there are no further
standards to ensure conformance to.  And even if I could, I'm sure
Microsoft would probably want to seek legal actions against myself or
other GCOM users or developers.

   Therefore, I must point out that GCOM is a pure implementation of
COM, totally clean-room design, without any Microsoft influence, short
of their publically available standards document.  This means that GCOM
will inevitably have an incompatible distributed object infrastructure,
a completely incompatible moniker file format, unique registry layouts,
etc.  Indeed, the core services delivered by the minimum GCOM
configuration will likely be very different from Microsoft's
implementation, shipped with every copy of Windows.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) However, an IDL compiler is very much recommended if you're
going to be implementing distributed objects, because it saves you the
hassle of having to write interfaces to marshal and unmarshal
parameters.

   (2) Fortunately, the additional complexity required for aggregation
is localized only to those objects which actually _needs_ such
flexibility.

   (3) This is based on observations of code output from ORBit, MICO,
and OmniORB.

   (4) I have no firm data to back this up, however.

   (6) I believe this happens for CORBA as well, as identity comparison
requires the proxy to invoke the `Object::hash()' function to compute
identity equivalency; therefore, CORBA has no significant gain over COM
in this field of application either.

2.1 Introduction
================

The Component Object Model ("COM") was first created and used by
Microsoft as the enabling technology behind their Object Linking and
Embedding technology for their Office 6.0 application suite.  Since
then, COM has found increasing amounts of use throughout the Windows
platform.  COM is now the foundation technology behind ActiveX (drop-in
user interface components which can be used almost anywhere, ranging
from web pages to Visual BASIC applications), Active Data Objects (the
object oriented interface for ODBC), DirectX (Microsoft's high
performance video subsystem), Media Player plug-in modules, the user
interface shell itself, and more.  Indeed, one can argue that COM is
the new Windows API.

   COM has also found increasing popularity outside of Microsoft's
headquarters.  COM is now found in such public domain or freeware
software packages as the Flux Operating System Toolkit, and is the
central object model employed by Mozilla, the highly cross platform web
browser destined to replace the current generation of Netscape web
browsers.

   COM's popularity over other standards, such as CORBA, SOM, and Java,
stems from two absolutely critical features: it's astonishingly easy to
understand how COM works from the inside out, and it's incredibly fast.

   COM also has certain shortcomings which makes COM appear to be more
trouble than its worth.  COM tends to be very code centric, not data
centric; as a result, more boilerplate code is required initially to get
an object implementation working under COM than other object models.
However, the boilerplate code needed by COM amounts to about the same
amount of meta-data for other object systems for all but the smallest
object implementations.  Also, boilerplate in COM tends to grow at a
smaller rate than it does for CORBA(1).

   This document does not make any attempts to explain all of COM and
its benefits, or its API, to the reader.  In fact, it doesn't even make
use of any form of Interface Description Language (IDL) to make your
life easier.  Instead, this document explains how to write a component
library which implements one or more COM classes, using nothing more
than your C compiler, and how to make its presence known to the rest of
the system.  Thanks to the simplicity of COM, however, reading this
tutorial will give valuable insight on how COM works from both a server
and a client perspective.

   There are two concepts which must be learned before proceeding
further - that of clients and servers.  The words describe various
roles a piece of software fulfill.  A client, for example, is any piece
of software which submits a request for a service.  A server, then, is
any piece of software that actually provides a service.  Please note
that a single piece of software can simultaneously be a client AND a
server.

   Most components are designed to work with the COM subsystem as a
shared object, also known as a library.  This allows the COM subsystem
to dynamically load COM object implementations as they are needed, and
to unload them when appropriate.  Another advantage to this is that
there is no cross-address-space overhead for invoking methods.
Consider a widget toolkit for a graphical user interface, and try to
imagine the sheer amount of overhead that would exist if the user had
to invoke services in another running process for every on-screen (and
perhaps even off-screen) widget it wanted to create.  Even
custom-designed, hand-crafted RPC mechanisms don't help with the basic
inadequacies of this method, as the FreeDesktop's efforts to replace
Xlib with a leaner, meaner implementation demonstrates.

   However, it is also true that COM components _should_ be totally
location transparent to support objects that _do_ reside outside of a
program's address space.  Indeed, COM does exhibit this property.
However, this tutorial will not demonstrate such mechanisms.

2.2 A Word About Class Versus Component Libraries
=================================================

There has been confusion on when to use the term "class library" and
when to use "component library".  Libraries designed to provide
implementations of COM objects are known as component libraries _or_ as
class libraries.  The former name is preferred, so as to disambiguate
them from language-specific class libraries.  The latter name is quite
common in the Windows programming world, so you'll quite likely see its
use with respect to GCOM as well.  It's good to be aware of both.

compilers.

2.3 Defining Interfaces
=======================

Every component library is generally broken up into three major
subsections.  The first is the interface between the component library
and the COM run-time environment itself.  The second is the collection
of class factory objects.  The third and final subsection provides the
implementation behind the objects manufactured by the factory objects.
The example library presented in this tutorial only has one type of
object under its control, so only one class factory and one object
implementation.  However, the concept isn't hard to extend to differing
numbers of object implementations.

   Let's start our tutorial by defining a COM interface which can
accept a string for later display, retrieve the string, and display it.
Here's what such an interface would look like using straight C:

       /* in IDisplayText.h */

       #include <gcom/gcom.h>

       typedef struct IDisplayText IDisplayText;
       typedef struct IDisplayTextVtbl IDisplayTextVtbl;

       struct IDisplayText
       {
          IDisplayTextVtbl *epv;
       };

       struct IDisplayTextVtbl
       {
          HRESULT (*QueryInterface)( IDisplayText *, REFIID, void ** );
          uint32 (*AddRef)( IDisplayText * );
          uint32 (*Release)( IDisplayText * );
          HRESULT (*SetText)( IDisplayText *, char *, uint32 );
          HRESULT (*GetText)( IDisplayText *, char *, uint32 );
          HRESULT (*Display)( IDisplayText * );
       };

   This, in and of itself, isn't really all that bad.  But it sure is a
lot to type, and as a result, very error prone.  In addition, each
interface has a set of methods which are always required:
`QueryInterface()', `AddRef()', and `Release()' (these three methods
comprise the `IUnknown' interface).

   The GCOM SDK provides a set of macros which helps automate the
creation of interfaces:

       /* in IDisplayText.h */

       #include <gcom/gcom.h>

       BEGIN_INTERFACE( IDisplayText )
          HRESULT (*SetText)( IDisplayText *, char *, uint32 );
          HRESULT (*GetText)( IDisplayText *, char *, uint32 );
          HRESULT (*Display)( IDisplayText * );
       END_INTERFACE( IDisplayText )

   This is not only much smaller, but it also guarantees correctness of
the interface definition to the degree that `IUnknown' is defined
correctly for the interface.

   Interfaces in COM are identified by a unique integer that's 128-bits
long.  Note that this integer does _not_ identify a specific
implementation of a given interface -- only the interface definition
itself.  Interface IDs are named starting with `IID_', followed by the
name of the interface (which traditionally starts with the capital
letter `I').  So the interface identifier for `IDisplayText' would read
`IID_IDisplayText'.  We enable applications to reference
`IID_IDisplayText' using the following construct:

       /* in IDisplayText.h */

       /* {CE41F1D8-349C-11D5-8000-000001135627} */
       extern REFIID IID_IDisplayText;

   Note that we don't actually provide the interface ID definition
within the header file itself, as with other COM implementations.  This
is because many C compiler toolchains have a few bugs in them which
prevent the use of static constant data structures.  As a result, the
actual definition must be provided in some external source form.
Besides, following this procedure for defining COM interfaces, while a
little more inconvenient for the C programmer, does produce smaller
executables because the same data constants aren't defined in the final
binary more than once.

       /* in IDispatchText.c */

       #include "IDispatchText.h"

       /* {CE41F1D8-349C-11D5-8000-000001135627} */
       DECLARE_IID(
             IDisplayText,
             0xCE41F1D8,
             0x349C, 0x11D5, 0x8000,
             0x00, 0x00, 0x01, 0x13, 0x56, 0x27
            )

   Where did we get the number from?  GCOM ships with a utility called
`genuuid', which produces a UUID for you(1).  This utility, however,
currently should _not_ be used if you have a more capable utility, such
as the `uuidgen' tool, which is bundled with the ext2fs/ext3fs tools in
Linux.  With either tool, simply use the components from the output
produced by the tool in the header file.  By convention, the output of
the UUID generation command is placed as a C comment before the
declaration, as shown above, and as a comment to the `extern REFIID'
statement in the corresponding .h file.

   OK, so we have two files called `IDisplayText.h' and
`IDisplayText.c'.  These files define important constants and
structures needed to set forth a "contract" between the client and
server.  Now what we need to do is actually start implementing a COM
component library that actually creates objects which supports the
`IDisplayText' interface.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Due to its incomplete status, be sure to recompile `genuuid'
with the hardware MAC address of your preferred Ethernet card, since it
lacks any means for auto-detecting this information itself, at the time
of this writing.

2.4 Object Factories
====================

The COM run-time environment doesn't have enough knowledge about the
various classes in the system to be able to instantiate objects.  For
this reason, COM defers all object creation to the responsible component
libraries.  It actually turns out that this is what you'd want to do
anyway; a COM object can be implemented in _any_ language, not just in
C.  It does this by acquiring an `IClassFactory' interface from the
component library.  Keep in mind that a single library _can_ provide
more than one class factory.

   Class factory objects are full-fledged COM objects in their own
right.  This means that they exhibit the `IUnknown' interface as well
as the `IClassFactory'-specific methods `CreateInstance()' and
`LockServer()'.  There exists only one class factory object per class
of objects in the system.  For this reason, you'll quite often see
class factory implementations that are defined at the library's global
scope (as we will in this section).

   The first step towards creating the class factory object is to define
what data a class factory needs.  We know that the library cannot be
unloaded if there are still objects which the class is responsible for
in existance.  We also know that we cannot unload the library if the
number of references to the factory is greater than zero.  In addition,
the COM specification allows for a class implementation to be "locked"
in memory, via the `LockServer()' method on the class factory object.
Therefore, a minimal class factory would look something like this:

       /* in IClassFactory_impl.h */

       #include <gcom/gcom.h>

       typedef struct IClassFactory_impl IClassFactory_impl;
       struct IClassFactory_impl
       {
          IClassFactoryVtbl *epv; /* Same as IClassFactory */

          uint32 objectCount;
          uint32 lockCount;
          uint32 referenceCount;
       };

   And we define the class factory statically in `IClassFactory_impl.c':

       /* in IClassFactory_impl.c */

       #include "IClassFactory_impl.h"
       #include "IDisplayText_impl.h"

       static HRESULT QueryInterface( IClassFactory *, REFIID, void ** );
       static uint32 AddRef( IClassFactory * );
       static uint32 Release( IClassFactory * );
       static HRESULT CreateInstance(
                   IClassFactory *,
                   const IUnknown *,
                   REFIID,
                   void **
                  );
       static HRESULT LockServer( IClassFactory *, Bool );

       extern void InitializeDisplayTextObject( IDisplayText_impl * );

       /* ... */

       static IClassFactoryVtbl vtbl =
       {
          &QueryInterface,
          &AddRef,
          &Release,
          &CreateInstance,
          &LockServer
       };

       IClassFactory_impl g_ClassFactory =
       {
          &vtbl,
          0,
          0,
          0
       };

       /* ... */

       static HRESULT QueryInterface(
                   IClassFactory *pcf,
                   REFIID riid,
                   void **ppvResult
                  )
       {
          HRESULT hr = E_NOINTERFACE;

          *ppvResult = NULL;

          if( IsEqualIID( IID_IUnknown, riid ) ||

           self -> referenceCount--;
       }

          /* Aggregation is discussed in another tutorial.  For now,

           */
          if( punkOuter != NULL )
           return E_NOAGGREGATION;

          pdtImpl = (IDisplayText_impl *)
                ( malloc( sizeof( IDisplayText_impl ) ) );

                   );
             if( FAILED(hr) )
                pdtImpl -> lpVtbl -> Release( (IDisplayText *)pdtImpl );
             else
                g_ClassFactory.objectCount++;
          }

          return hr;
       }

       static HRESULT LockServer( IClassFactory *pcf, Bool reallyLock )
       {
          IClassFactory_impl *self = (IClassFactory_impl *)pcf;

          if( reallyLock == TRUE )
             g_ClassFactory.lockCount++;
          else
          {
             if( g_ClassFactory.lockCount != 0 )
                g_ClassFactory.lockCount--;
          }

          return S_OK;
       }

   Two things still need to go into the `IClassFactory_impl.c' file: a
method of determining whether or not it's safe to unload the library,
and a method of letting the COM subsystem acquire access to the class
factory object.  As you might have guessed, classes, or more accurately
_factories_, are identified using a 128-bit UUID, just like interfaces
are(1).  The class IDs are defined in a manner precisely the same as
that for interfaces:

       /* in CLSID_Example1.h */

       #include <gcom/gcom.h>

       /* {87E7146A-34A2-11D5-8000-000001135627} */
       extern REFCLSID CLSID_Example1;



       /* in CLSID_Example1.c */

       #include "CLSID_Example1.h"

       /* {87E7146A-34A2-11D5-8000-000001135627} */
       DECLARE_CLSID(
               Example1,
               0x87E7146A,
               0x34A2, 0x11D5, 0x8000,
               0x00, 0x00, 0x01, 0x13, 0x56, 0x27
              );

   Before continuing, I would like to point out that the number space
used for IIDs and CLSIDs are distinct.  So, in reality, we _could_ have
used the same UUID for both `IID_IDisplayText' and `CLSID_Example1'.
Also, unlike IIDs, CLSIDs _do_ identify a particular object
implementation.  Because CLSIDs are themselves UUIDs, and therefore
guaranteed to be unique in a system, there is no need to qualify them
with any other information, including version information.  A different
version component library simply has a different class ID.  Libraries
which provide backward compatibility do so by responding with the same
class factory object to multiple class IDs (one for each major
revision).

   *NOTE*  When revising a component library to provide incremental
enhancements, in particular one that does not require a change to an
interface's binary level definition, it's generally `not' a good idea
to issue a new class ID for it.  However, if you're adding an amount of
new functionality that does require modifying the structural definition
of an interface, then it is required that you assign a new class ID for
the new version.

   Anyway, back to our regularly scheduled source code:

       /* back in IClassFactory_impl.c */

       HRESULT DllCanUnloadNow( void )
       {
          if( g_ClassFactory.objectCount != 0 )
           return S_FALSE;

          if( g_ClassFactory.referenceCount != 0 )
           return S_FALSE;

          if( g_ClassFactory.lockCount != 0 )
           return S_FALSE;

          return S_OK;
       }

       HRESULT DllGetClassObject(
               REFCLSID rclsid,
               REFIID riid,
               void **ppvResult
              )
       {
          HRESULT hr = E_CLASSNOTREG;

          if( IsEqualIID( CLSID_Example1, rclsid ) )
          {
             hr = QueryInterface(
                     (IClassFactory *)&g_ClassFactory,
               riid,
               ppvResult
              );
          }

          return hr;
       }

   At this point, we have completed the `IClassFactory_impl.c' file.
As you can see, there's a bit of boiler plate code there.  Fortunately,
with component libraries that implement more than one class of objects,
a large portion of the above code can be re-used very effectively.  Now
all that's left is the implementation of the display objects.
